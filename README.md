🚀 Completed Level-2 
Task: Customer Segmentation

📊 Domain: Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

📌 Internship: Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship

🛠 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, KMeans, PCA, Google Colab

During this project, I worked on a real-world customer dataset from a retail platform to perform Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering.

🔍 Key Steps Performed:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

Optimal cluster selection using the Elbow Method

KMeans Clustering for segmenting customers

Visualized clusters using PCA for dimensionality reduction

Analyzed cluster behavior for strategic insights

🎯 Key Insights:

Identified high-value customers based on their spending habits

Segmented customer base into 4 distinct behavioral groups

Suggested marketing strategies based on customer profiles

👉 This hands-on task enhanced my understanding of unsupervised learning, EDA, and data-driven business strategies.
